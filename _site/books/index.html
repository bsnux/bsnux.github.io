		<p>Undoubtedly, the iPhone is one of the most exciting mobile devices in the world. Its iOS is used in other Apple devices such as the iPad and iPod Touch. With this book you'll learn how to build and develop applications for these devices without applying Apple's burdensome and at times restrictive technologies. Just use your experience and knowledge combined with web front-end technologies like JavaScript to build quality web apps. Nobody will know you haven't used Objective-C and Cocoa.</p>
		<p> This book offers a set of practical and clear recipes with a step-by-step approach for building your own iPhone applications applying only web technologies such as JavaScript and AJAX. Web developers won't need to learn a new programming language for building iOS applications with a native look and feel.</p>

		<p>This book is a practical guide for all those Windows users who want to start using Linux.
		In practical terms, it indicates the possibilities of replacing Windows with Linux and perform all the tasks
		usually run with the PC. Mandriva was chose for this guide, although there are a variety of distributions
		of GNU / Linux, for two main reasons: ease of use of its graphical interface and wide range of applications.
		All applications mentioned in the book may be installed on any other distribution, which means that the concepts
		taught on Mandriva will be useful in other popular distributions as Ubuntu, openSUSE and Fedora.</p>
		<p>The guide discusses the main features of Linux, and how to install and configure Mandriva. Then it reviews the
		main applications included in this distribution and, finally it focuses on different groups: office automation and
		productivity, Internet, multimedia, graphics and digital photography. In order to facilitate the transition
		between operating systems, each application of Mandriva finds its equivalent in Windows, so allows the
		reader to quickly become familiar with the operating system.</p>
